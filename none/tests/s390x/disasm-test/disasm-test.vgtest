# We do not want disasm-test to be run under the auspices of valgrind.
# Therefore the real test here is run in the "post" command.

# Excluded opcodes:
# exrl  - Offset is expected to denote a decodable insn; no such scaffolding
# kma   - Cannot express constraint that r3 must be different from r1 and r2
# srnmb - The compile-time checkable constraint cannot be expressed in opcode.c
